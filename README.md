# Math 214 Final Project: (Discrete) Fourier Transforms

Application: signal & audio processing

Description:
- `brickwall.py` implements simple high-pass and low-pass brickwall filters
- `fancy_attenuation.py` implements an amplitude-per-octave logarithmic filter
- Some sample audio recordings and their descriptions are in `.wav/`
- The results of our filters are under `piano-export/`
- Sample plots are under `figures/`
